# UE4-Deck-Of-Cards


<!-- OVERVIEW -->
This tutorial series is intended for those wanting an introduction to *C++* and its integration into *Unreal*. using their scripting language <i>GML</i>. This assumes basic knowledge of a C style programming language and a basic understanding of Unreal engine.

Now before we take some of what we learned about C++ and take it into Unreal, lets get set up. Lets get a card, change the render view to 2-D for a deck of cards and get a mesh, material, and camera to all work. We will adapt our style from an all C++ approach to one that makes the most sense within the confines of the UE4 engine.
